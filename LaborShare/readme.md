# Most Recent Working Paper
  * [Automation, Human Task Innovation, and Labor Share: Unveiling the Role of Elasticity of Substitution](https://github.com/ubuzuz/public/blob/e202933573c09a71cc842ea129f0827ed6e4c7fb/LaborShare/Automation__Human_Task_Innovation__and_Labor_Share.pdf)
# Instructions for Running the Code
  * Begin by downloading the required files using ~~this link~~. (We will provide this link after publication.)
    * This zip file has been checked and is free of viruses and malware.
    * Please note, initializing the download will take some time due to the large file size.
  * Once the download is complete, execute the file named "master.do".
# Description of Required Datasets
##### Public access is allowed under proper citation:
  * Datasets such as US-Census, OECD STAN, KLEMS, ONET, UN-Comtrade, and others are open to the public. 
  * The US-Census dataset has a substantial storage volume, which might cause a lengthy download and processing time. 
  * We recommend utilizing the KLEMS data and codes that we have provided.
    * Although it's possible to download directly from the website listed below, we don't recommend this approach.
      * To access the 2023 vintage release of KLEMS, visit https://euklems-intanprod-llee.luiss.it/.
      * For the download of all available vintages, refer to Gutiérrez, G., & Piton, S. (2020)'s replication code and data.
      * Be aware that downloading all vintages directly from the official KLEMS webpage may not work efficiently, or it may require a substantial amount of time.
##### The following datasets are not publicly accessible (Impossible to replicate without these datasets): 
  * EU-LFS:
    * While this dataset is free, access requires an application for data permission, which typically takes around two months to process.
    * We are using the 2023 release of this dataset.
    * After downloading, save it in the /Secured/EULFS folder in the current directory.
    * The file format should look like this:
      * [![file format](https://github.com/jayjeo/public/raw/main/Laborshare/format.png)](#features)
  * IFR:
    * Access to this dataset requires purchasing the IFR data. This process usually takes a few days.
    * We are using the 2023 release of this dataset.
    * After downloading, save it in the /Secured/ folder in the current directory. The file name should be IFRdata.csv
  * CompNet:
    * This dataset is freely accessible to the public with a proper application, but redistribution is prohibited.
    * Access to it requires an application for data permission, which typically takes about a week to process.
    * We are using the 8th Round version.
      * Manually download the 8th Round of the Comp-Net file, named ``unconditional_industry2d_all_unweighted''.
      * After downloading, save it in the /Secured folder in the current directory. The file name should be unconditional_industry2d_all_unweighted.dta
