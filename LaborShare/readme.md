# Instructions for Running the Code
  * Begin by downloading the files using [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ii6nj2rw32e32kqfdihd5/LaborShareCode.zip?rlkey=hgwjcc1ekulr0nomloydwgj6p&dl=0)
    * This zip file has been verified and is free from viruses and malware.
    * Please be aware that initializing the download may take some time due to the large size of the file.
  * After the download is complete, execute the file named 'master.do'.

# Overview of Required Datasets
##### Public access is permitted with appropriate citation.:
  * Datasets such as US-Census, OECD STAN, KLEMS, ONET, UN-Comtrade, and others are open to the public. 
  * We recommend utilizing the KLEMS data and codes provided by us.
    * Although direct download from the website listed below is possible, we advise against this approach.
      * To access the 2023 vintage release of KLEMS, please visit https://euklems-intanprod-llee.luiss.it/.
      * For downloading all available vintages, please refer to the replication code and data provided by Gutiérrez, G., and Piton, S. (2020).
      * Please note that downloading all vintages directly from the official KLEMS webpage may not be efficient, or it could require a considerable amount of time.
##### The datasets listed below are not available for public access.
```diff
- It is impossible to replicate the study without the datasets listed below.
```
  * EU-LFS:
    * Although this dataset is free, accessing it requires an application for data permission, which is typically processed within approximately two months.
    * We are utilizing the 2023 release of this dataset.
    * After downloading, please save the file in the /Secured/EULFS folder located in the current directory.
    * The file format should appear as follows:
      * [![file format](https://github.com/jayjeo/public/raw/main/Laborshare/format.png)](#features)
  * International Federation of Robotics:
    * Accessing this dataset necessitates the purchase of the IFR data, a process that typically takes a few days.
    * We are utilizing the 2023 release of this dataset.
    * After downloading, please save the file in the /Secured folder within the current directory. The file should be named 'IFRdata.csv'.
  * CompNet:
    * This dataset is freely accessible to the public upon submission of a proper application, however, its redistribution is strictly prohibited.
    * Access to this dataset necessitates an application for data permission, which is typically processed within approximately one week.
    * We are utilizing the 8th Round version of the dataset.
      * Manually download the 8th Round of the Comp-Net file, which is named 'unconditional_industry2d_all_unweighted.'
      * After downloading, please save the file in the /Secured folder located within the current directory. The file should be named 'unconditional_industry2d_all_unweighted.dta'.
